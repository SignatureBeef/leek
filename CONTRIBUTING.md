- **Pull requests are welcome** but may take time to review and merge depending on complexity and availability.

## How to contribute

### Bug reports and feature suggestions
- First, check [open issues](https://github.com/SignatureBeef/leek/issues) to avoid duplicates.
- Include clear steps to reproduce bugs if possible. One liners may be rejected, or be de-prioritized.
- Describe expected vs. actual behavior.
- Feature suggestions should include rationale and ideally link to real-world scenarios.

### Code contributions
1. Fork the repository and work in a branch.
2. Follow the existing project structure and coding style â€” though these are not yet set in stone, so strong opinions are welcome.
3. Double-check your editor config is working.
4. Include or update tests if relevant.
5. Run `dotnet test` before submitting â€” though we plan to automate this in future CI workflows, too.
6. Open a pull request with a meaningful description.

### Documentation & examples
Contributions to documentation are always welcome:
- Fix typos or outdated information.
- Improve CLI usage examples or integration guidance.
- Add real-world use cases or onboarding tips.
